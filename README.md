# C_assignment_01

Make a program to calculate and verify the CRC checksum of a message according to the below requirements. 
Download the crc15.c file and develop the program in the file.

Requirements
1. The message is an N element array of unsigned char (uint8_t)
2. The minimum length of the message is 1 character.
3. The maximum length of the message is 14 characters.
4. The CRC-15 polynomial is 0xC599 (1100010110011001).
5. The message is processed from the first element to the last element in the array.
6. Every byte is processed from the LSB to the MSB.
7. No magic number!
